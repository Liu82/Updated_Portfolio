# Updated_Portfolio

This assignent is to update our portfolio and make it more "US' we are to add our projects into the portfolio portion of the website. 


Your updated site should have the following content:

* Your name

* Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number

* A link to a PDF of your resume

* List of projects. For each project make sure you have the following:

  * Project title

  * Link to the deployed version

  * Link to the code on GitHub

  * At least 3 deployed projects

  * External content:

  * Update your LinkedIn with the projects you've worked on so far

  * Update the README for each project you linked to with a description of the problem,
  how you solved it, and some information about your technical approach

  * Suggested: refactor some of your code from earlier assignments to make them more readable

Competitive Design

* Mobile-first design: you should be proud to pull out your phone and share
your portfolio site with a friend, family member, or someone at a meetup.

* Polish: choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like
the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

* Images: add a meaningful screenshot for each of your projects
